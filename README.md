**Objective:** This repository contains the codebase and documentation for a project that applies Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)â€”specifically Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to predict drug-drug interactions (DDIs) using the OGB-DDI dataset and extend the approach to Alzheimer's Disease drug repurposing using the AlzKB biomedical knowledge graph. </br>
To understand the repo check [**HOWTO.md**](./HOWTO.md) file.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Drug repurposing offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to traditional drug development, especially for complex diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s. In this project, we:

- Perform link prediction on drug-drug interaction data using GATs.
- Use classical and deep learning baselines (Logistic Regression, MLP).
- Extend GNN models to heterogeneous biomedical graphs for drug-Alzheimerâ€™s association prediction.

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

- **[OGB-DDI](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/linkprop/)**: A large-scale homogeneous graph for drug-drug interaction prediction.
- **[AlzKB](https://alzkb.ai/Home)**: A heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph focused on Alzheimerâ€™s Disease.

## ðŸ§  Models Implemented

- **GCN** (2-layer)
- **GraphSAGE** (2-layer)
- **GIN** (2-layer)
- **GAT** (2-layer)
- Classical baselines: Logistic Regression and MLP using handcrafted features

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics

- **Hits@K** (K = 10, 20, 50, 100)
- Binary Cross Entropy Loss
- Mean Reciprocal Rank (optional, if implemented)

## Setup

Please follow the following steps to run the project locally <br/>

1. `git clone https://github.com/BinglanLi/CS221_MISB.git`
2. Open Anaconda console/Terminal and navigate into project directory `cd path_to_repo`
3. Run `conda create --name <env_name> python==3.10`.
4. Run `conda activate <env_name>` (for running scripts from your console or set the interpreter in your IDE)

For adding the new conda environment to the jupyter notebook follow this additional instruction
1. Run `conda install -c anaconda ipykernel`
2. Run `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<env_name>`

-----

For pytorch installation:

PyTorch pip package will come bundled with some version of CUDA/cuDNN with it,
but it is highly recommended that you install a system-wide CUDA beforehand, mostly because of the GPU drivers. 
I also recommend using Miniconda installer to get conda on your system.
Follow through points 1 and 2 of [this setup](https://github.com/Petlja/PSIML/blob/master/docs/MachineSetup.md)
and use the most up-to-date versions of Miniconda and CUDA/cuDNN for your system.

-----

For other module installation, please follow the following steps:
1. Open Anaconda console/Terminal and navigate into project directory `cd path_to_repo`
2. Run `conda activate <env_name>`
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` found ðŸ‘‰ [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt)

## Usage

For visualizing a model for a task, please follow the following steps after running `conda activate <env_name>` 

```cmd
jupyter notebook 
```
